# Hosting

To make a website available is necessary to host in a server. The server normally lives in a data center that provides power, network, hardware, and security.

Type of Hosting
Shared hosting
- downside resources sharing 
- affordable
- compartmization of hosting accounts; percentage of CPU, RAM, etc
- DDoS in another site does not impact the site
- DoS like power of the server affects our site
- fixed amount of resources for all accounts

VPS
- virtual private server
- step ahead in compartmization garanteed resources 
- vertical scalability
- difficult management

Managed VPS
- same as VPS
- not necessary to manage the server

Dedicated hosting
- physical server
- more powerful since there is no kind of sharing
- more expensive

Dynamic and static content

Static: plain HTML sent from the server to the client

Dynamic: the server processes the content or generates it on the fly from a database. More flexible and complex.
